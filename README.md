UNDERSTANDING INFORMAL TEXTS, ABBREVIATIONS AND EMOTICONS USING NLP FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Abstract. 

Nowadays, the usage of social media has grown to a large ex- tent. And the use of Informal texts and emoticons is common to express their feelings in chatting, blogs etc. Understanding abbreviations/ short- hand and emoticons from the normal texts are one of the challenging tasks. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase, with lo- cations, cultures etc. People use different abbreviations of the same word and understanding those abbreviations with respect to proper semantics is one of the backbreaking tasks by a computer. In this paper, our objec- tive is to detect shorthand/abbreviations and emoticons meaning from the normal conversation with the help of our new proposed system which is using the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm
Keywords: emoticons, shorthand message, abbreviation
